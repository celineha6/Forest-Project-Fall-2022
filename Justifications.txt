All create methods and parse methods were not moved. They should stay in functions because each entity will
have its own class in Project 3.

In the file Action, executeSaplingActivity, executeTreeActivity, executeDudeNotFullActivity,executeDudeFullActivity,
executeFairyActivity, have been moved to action because they are used by another function called executeActivityAction.
Since their only purpose is to be used by this function they should belong to the same class as this function.
